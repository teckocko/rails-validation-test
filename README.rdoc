This is the task i got from a senior rails programmer, to see how i would solve it.

Task:

Create a form that contains two fieds, email and text. Email field can accept multiple emails, separated by comma or space and needs to be validated without refreshing the page, and error messages should be displayed for every invalid email (eg. "this email is invalid", "that email is invalid", ...). On successful submition redirect to index.
